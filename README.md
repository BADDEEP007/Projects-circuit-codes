# Tinkercad and Wokwi Circuit Designs and Code for Small Projects

Welcome to this repository! This project collection includes various circuit designs and working code for Arduino and ESP32, developed and tested in Tinkercad and Wokwi simulators. Additionally, it includes MySQL database setup and website code.

## Projects Included

### 1. **Simple Washing Machine Circuit**
   - **Platform**: Arduino (Simulated in Tinkercad)
   - **Description**: A basic circuit design to simulate an automatic washing machine. The code manages the washing machineâ€™s cycle, integrating functionalities like water filling, agitation, and spin-dry.
   - **Files**:
     - `washing_machine.ino`: Arduino code for washing machine logic.
     - Circuit design files (in Tinkercad format).

### 2. **Alarm Clock with RTC**
   - **Platform**: Arduino with DS1307 RTC Module (Simulated in Wokwi)
   - **Description**: A fully functional digital alarm clock using an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module to keep track of time. The alarm triggers based on preset times.
   - **Files**:
     - `alarm_clock.ino`: Code for alarm clock functionality.
     - Circuit design files (in Wokwi format).

### 3. **Traffic Light Signal**
   - **Platform**: Arduino (Simulated in Tinkercad)
   - **Description**: Simulates a traffic light signal system with timed transitions between red, yellow, and green lights.
   - **Files**:
     - `traffic_light_signal.ino`: Code for traffic light sequence control.
     - Circuit design files (in Tinkercad format).

### 4. **MQTT Protocol Simulation**
   - **Platform**: ESP32/ESP8266 (Simulated in Tinkercad and Wokwi)
   - **Description**: Demonstrates the use of the MQTT protocol for IoT applications, allowing communication between devices.
   - **Files**:
     - `mqtt_example.ino`: ESP32/ESP8266 code for MQTT communication.
     - Circuit design files (in Tinkercad and Wokwi formats).

### 5. **MySQL Database and Website**
   - **Description**: Contains code for a simple MySQL database setup and a website that interacts with the database. Ideal for applications that require data storage and retrieval.
   - **Files**:
     - `database_setup.sql`: SQL script for setting up the database.
     - `website_code/`: Folder containing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and backend files for the website.
